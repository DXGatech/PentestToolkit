VenomAutomation is an easy-to-use trojan generator specially designed for OSX penetration based on metasploit. While it also supports trojans against other major platforms, the default OSX generator is recommended, as it has been tested by the major virus-detection engines and is proved to be competent.

```
#To use the shell script:
./AutomatedTrojanGen.sh
#To clean up the intermediate files that are generated for trojan construction:
./clean_up.sh
```

**The Wireless Automation kit**
There're two simple python scripts for wireless pentesting. 
arp_spoofing.py redirects the target's network traffic to the attacker and then forwards it to the target website. Network DoSing is also supported.
dhcp_dos.py seeks to fill the address buffer of the target router.

No engine detected the OSX trojan
